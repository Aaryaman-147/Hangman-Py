# Hangman-Py
It is a simple classic word-guessing game built using Python where players try to uncover a hidden word by guessing letters one at a time. Each incorrect guess adds a part to the "hangman," and the game ends when the player either correctly guesses the word or runs out of attempts.

## Features
- Three Difficulty Levels to choose from (easy, medium and hard)
- Dynamic Word Bank(predefined word list)
- Hint Option
- Visual representation of ASCII art

## How to Play

- Start the game by running the script on your device.
- Choose a difficulty level.
- Type a letter to guess; If the letter is in the word, it fills in the correct spot(s), but if it is wrong, you lose an attempt.
- If you're stuck, you can use a hint to reveal a letter.
